## Links to resources
### Resources for the course
[Course BlackBoard pages]()  You will need to use your university login to access this.

The [download page for R at our nearest CRAN mirror](http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/)

The [RStudio Desktop download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Once you have these installed you should install the **tidyverse** package by issuing the command *install.packages("tidyverse")* .  Link to the [tidyverse home page](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which in turn has a link to Wickham and Grolemund's book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which you can read online for free.

Link to the [Notepad++ text editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  This is what I use to edit markdown documents and most text documents I run into; great replacement for the Windows notepad editor.

The [LibreOffice software](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is an alternative to the Microsoft Office suite.  LibreOffice edits documents in open formats, and so works very well with Google docs.

[Git software](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

[Github](https://github.com/) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for sharing projects and version control.

### Resources for data science
The [Open Source Data Science Master's Degree curriculum](http://datasciencemasters.org/).  If we only had enough time to go through all of this...

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for predictive modeling and data analysis.  Lots of great examples of data analysis performed on real world data sets.

[KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) for news and articles from the data science world.

[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).  Blogs written by people who use or are learning to use R.  Great place to search for common R tasks and how to perform them.

[stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)'s list of newest R questions.  Great place to search when R is giving you problems, throwing errors, etc.



## Future additions

### Planned additions for Spring 2019:
* Add example R scripts for some basic tasks: I need a table connecting scripts and tasks, since some scripts may cover more than one task.
* Exercises to accompany R for Beginners
* Articles for article reflections
* Projects
* Rubrics for assignments, projects, etc.
* RMarkdown examples.  These can be longer analyses.

### Planned additions for future iterations of the course:
* Optional parallel material in Python as Jupyter notebooks
* Screencasts of various tasks
* Add discussion forum(s) in BlackBoard or some other place?
