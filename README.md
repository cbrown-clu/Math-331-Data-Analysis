# Math 331 Data Analysis
This is the repository for the Math 331 course.  In this folder you can find the grading scheme and course schedule.

Other folders in the repository include:
* Example scripts in R
* Example document source and output in RMarkdown
* Optional parallel material in Python as Jupyter notebooks
* Data sets used in the class
* Course reading materials
* Links to resources

Planning additions:
* List of software and links - R, RStudio, Notepad++, LibreOffice, Git, Github
* Add example R scripts for some basic tasks: read in data and change data types when necessary, create a computed factor, make some plots, using sapply, dealing with dates (could just point students to the quakes R script).  I need a table connecting scripts and tasks, since some scripts may cover more than one task.
* Exercises to accompany R for Beginners
* Articles for article reflections
* Projects???
* Rubrics for assignments, projects, etc.
* RMarkdown examples.  These can be longer analyses.
* Screencasts of me doing things???  How easy is this to do?  Do I need a webcam?
* Need to add links to BlackBoard.  Also need to link to a Google doc for assignments, readings, etc.
* Add discussion forum(s) in BlackBoard?
