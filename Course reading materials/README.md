# Course Reading Materials
You can find the course reading materials in this folder.  This includes the three main texts and supporting articles for the course.

The three main texts are:
* R For Beginners - An introduction to R coding.  There are lots of alternatives to this.  Some people prefer a task-oriented introduction, which you can find in the ISLR text below or in [Tony Fischetti's Data Analysis in R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/data-analysis-r) book.
* Notes on Probability, Simulation, and Sampling
* ISLR, the Introduction to Statistical Learning in R.

Learning R can probably best be done by following along with some code, figuring out what it does, and then trying to mimic it for your own project.  I've supplied some sample R scripts in this repository for you to look at.  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an incredibly useful resource for this sort of thing.
