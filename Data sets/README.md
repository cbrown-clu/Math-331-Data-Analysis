# Data sets for Math 331 Data Analysis With R
The data sets in this repository are provided as comma-separated value files (CSV with extension .csv) unless otherwise noted.  You can open CSV files with most spreadsheets and several commands in R, such as read.csv().  Here are some notes:
* The iris data set is available in R, using the data('iris') command.
* The [shuttle data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Challenger+USA+Space+Shuttle+O-Ring) is available from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
* The [movies data set](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) is available from the [Kaggle competition website](https://www.kaggle.com).
* The data sets from the [ISLR textbook](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html).
* The CLU Bookstore price data set was constructed by my Math 115 and 231 classes a few semesters back.  Thanks to all the students who put in time on this!
* The leaf data set was constructed by my Honors Science Seminar students in Spring 2017.  Thanks to all the students involved in that effort!
* The bouncing ball data set was constructed by my Calculus I course in Fall 2018.  Thanks to the students who put in work on that!
* The [search for exoplanets](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data) at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  This is time series data.
* The [monocular duck data set](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/djssy8yvz5/1) from the Journal of Animal Behavior.  Because of the original format of this data, data preparation and cleaning was more extensive.
* The [Kentish plover behavior dataset](https://www.datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.126818).
* [Red flour beetle behavioral data set](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/data-red-flour-beetle-coleoptera-tenebrionidae-response-volatile-cues-varies-strain-and-behavioral-assay).
* [Mudcrab behavioral data set](https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset-deployment/638861)
* Quakes is the seismic event data set from the region near Thousand Oaks.  Events are historical dating back to 1933.  This data was obtained from the [Southern California Earthquake Center's Data Catalog](http://service.scedc.caltech.edu/eq-catalogs/date_mag_loc.php).
