For the third article reflection, read [Detecting lunar cycles in marine biology: periodic regression versus categorical ANOVAS](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2001/214/m214p307.pdf) by deBruyn and Meeuwig.

For the reflection,

* Outline the main points in the article.

* What is the difference between what we might call "normal" regression and "periodic" regression?  This also brings up the point: what, really, *is* regression?  (Try Wikipedia!)

* What evidence do the authors put forward to support their claim that periodic regression is effective at detecting lunar cycles?

* Critique the use of graphics in the article.  Were they effective in conveying information?  What could have been done better?

Your write-up should be typed, single-spaced, and less than 4 pages in length.
