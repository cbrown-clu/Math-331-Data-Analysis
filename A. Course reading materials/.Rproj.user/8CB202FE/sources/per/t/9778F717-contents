# Introduction

\newpage
# Chapter 1 Exercises
**Exercise ** Install R.  [Link](https://cran.r-project.org/)

**Exercise ** Install RStudio.  [Link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

**Exercise ** Open RStudio, and find an "Introduction to RStudio" tutorial on YouTube.  Orient yourself to the interface.

**Exercise ** Install the tidyverse package set in R.  Get connected to the internet, open RStudio, visit the console, issue the command *install.packages("tidyverse")*, and set back and wait for a few minutes.

*Note:* At this point, between this install and the datasets in the course repository on Github, you should have everything you need for the exercises in this course.  For projects, you may have to install other packages or get other data sets depending on your needs.

**Exercise ** (Optional) Get a Kaggle account at [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/) .

**Exercise ** (Optional, highly recommended for CSC majors, data scientists) Get a Github account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) .  Also download the Github Desktop software and install it.  Find a tutorial on using the commit, clone, push, and pull operations on repositories, and get an understanding of branching.

# Chapter 2 Exercises
**Exercise ** Read Chapter 2 in R For Beginners.  Type in and execute the commands in the examples.

**Exercise **  Create a list of numbers from 0 to 1 with jumps of 0.01 and store it in *x* with the command
```{r}
x <- seq(from=0,to=1,by=0.01)
```
What is the length of *x*?  Use the *length* command.  What is the first element in *x*?  Try *x[1]* and *head(x,1)*.  What is the last element in *x*?  Try *x[length(x)]* and *head(x,1)*.

**Exercise ** Create a new list from *x* in the previous exercise using
```{r}
y <- x^2+2
```
What did this command do?

**Exercise ** We are now finished with *x* and *y*.  Remove them from your R environment with the *rm* command.
